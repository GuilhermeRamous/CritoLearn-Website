				<h1 class="titulo">Who is Changpeng Zhao AKA CZ?</h1>

				<p class="paragrafo">CZ is a Chinese-Canadian businessman and computer science grad, who first got involved with cryptocurrencies around 2013. He worked for crypto wallet/block explorer service Blockchain.info, as well as serving as CTO for the crypto project OKCoin.</p>
				<p class="paragrafo">CZ eventually decided that he wanted to launch his own crypto exchange. Heeding warnings from other crypto evangelists he'd met, such as Bitcoin Cash founder Roger Ver, he knew that it would be best to avoid connections with traditional financial institutions. This would mean fewer risks and regulatory complications. </p>
				<p class="paragrafo">Binance was thus launched as an entirely fiat-free trading platform, dedicated to crypto-to-crypto pairs. Coming right in the middle of Bitcoin's historic bull run, as cryptos were starting to gain a serious following, its July 2017 ICO raised a total of $200 million. </p>
				<p class="paragrafo">Initially dominated by Chinese traders, Binance soon caught on in a big way in the U.S., Japan, and other major markets. Its growth saw CZ being named as one of the top 3 richest people in crypto by Forbes in February 2018, with an estimated net worth of over $1.1 billion.</p>
				<p class="paragrafo">Binance eventually became the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, in April 2018 - just 9 months after its launch. Its average daily trading volume is now over $1 billion.</p>

				<h5 class="subtitulo">So what was the secret of CZ's success?</h5>

				<p class="paragrafo">As mentioned, his timing of the launch was perfect, arriving just as Bitcoin and altcoins were attracting huge mainstream interest and many people who had never traded before were looking for somewhere online to get started. Binance also boasted a number of unique features which enabled it to capitalize on this demand, and have secured its position as the top crypto exchange.</p>
				<p class="paragrafo">Speed is always one of the most important factors for a trading platform like this, and Binance's software is capable of processing over a million transactions per second, while still offering a highly accessible interface.</p>
				<p class="paragrafo">Furthermore, the exchange has always had a formidable number of trading pairs available, growing steadily from launch to a total of 246 at the time of writing. Binance's pioneering 'Community Coin of the Month' contest draws on the social appeal of other sites like Facebook and Twitter, giving users the opportunity to vote for which crypto project's token should be the next to be listed on the platform.</p>
				<p class="paragrafo">Creating a native crypto token for the exchange is another innovation that has driven Binance's success. If users choose to, they can convert the small amount of 'coin dust' they have left over after trades into Binance Coin (BNB). Doing this is cleverly incentivized by the offer of a 50 percent reduction on transaction fees, if they are paid in BNB. Binance Coin now has a market cap of over $1 billion, making it the 16th biggest crypto.</p>
				<p class="paragrafo">As popular as the platform might be, CZ and Binance's success hasn't been met with enthusiasm by everyone in the crypto community. Many figures, such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, are fundamentally opposed to its centralization, which they believe goes against everything cryptocurrencies were created for.</p>
				<p class="paragrafo">Others are similarly sceptical about the seemingly 'democratic' way Binance chooses which crypto tokens to list. Suggestions that companies can buy their way on to the platform regardless of the quality of their project are increasing, as are claims that the exchange demands exorbitant listing fees as another way for CZ to add to his wealth. </p>
				<p class="paragrafo">The level of influence that Binance now has over the cryptocurrency market is something that many have concerns about, and suspicions are also growing about the exchange's involvement with (or at least tolerance of) price manipulation.</p>
				<p class="paragrafo">Also, with his company taking a small cut of every crypto trade that is carried out, good or bad, it's not hard to see a conflict of interest in some of the announcements CZ shares with his 200,000+ followers on Twitter. </p>
				<p class="paragrafo">Hate it or love it, Binance definitely isn't going away anytime soon. And it would take another bull run of epic proportions for anyone to repeat the success that CZ has had in the world of crypto.</p>
