				<h1>Origin of Money</h1>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 25px">The history of civilization tells us that the primitive man tried to defend himself against the cold and the hunger, sheltering in caves and feeding on wild fruits, or what he could get from hunting and fishing. Over the centuries, with the development of intelligence, the human species became aware of the need for greater comfort and of repairing its similarity. Thus, as a result of individual needs, the exchanges arose.</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 25px">This system of direct exchange, which lasted for several centuries, gave rise to the emergence of words like "salary", payment made through a certain amount of salt; "Pecunia", from the Latin "pecus", which means flock (cattle) or "peculium", relative to the small cattle (sheep or goat).</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 25px">The first coins, as we know them today, pieces representing values, usually in metal, appeared in Lydia (present-day Turkey), in the 7th century BC The characteristics that one wanted to emphasize were transported to the pieces by the blow of a heavy object (hammer ), in primitive dies. It was the emergence of hammer-coining, where monetary signs were also valued by the nobility of the metals employed, such as gold and silver.</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 25px">Although the evolution of the times led to the substitution of gold and silver for less rare metals or their alloys, the association of the attributes of beauty and cultural expression with the passing of centuries has been preserved over the monetary value of the coins, which almost always , at present, present representative figures of the history, the culture, the riches and the power of the societies.</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 25px">The need to keep the coins safe has given rise to the banks. The gold and silver dealers, because they had coffers and guards at their service, began to accept the responsibility of taking care of their customers' money and giving written receipts of the amounts stored. These receipts (then known as "goldsmith's notes") have, over time, served as a means of payment for their possessors, because they are safer to carry than living money. Thus came the first "paper money" banknotes, or bank notes, at the same time as the custody of cash in kind gave rise to banking institutions.</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 25px">The first officially recognized banks appeared respectively in Sweden in 1656; in England in 1694; in France in 1700 and in Brazil in 1808 and the word "bank" came from the Italian "bank", a piece of wood that merchants from Italy and settled in London used to operate their businesses in the London public market.</p>
